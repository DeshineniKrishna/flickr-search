Used flickr.photos.search API provided by Flickr Services and made an Application as a part of my ReactJS learning.
This App has 
- A search bar that allows users to type.
- As a user types, display results fetched from that API.
- As user scroll down to the bottom of the page, displays more results.
- Save their search queries and display them as suggestions as they type it next time.
- Clicking on photo in the result will bring up photo and its title.
